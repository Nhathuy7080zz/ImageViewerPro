# 🎨 ImageViewer Pro v2.0 - UI/UX Improvements

**Date: May 27, 2025**  
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

## 📋 Improvements Summary

### 🔧 **1. Fixed Button Text Overlap Issue**
**Problem**: The "1️⃣ Actual" button had overlapping text that was hard to read
**Solution**: 
- Changed button text from "1️⃣ Actual" to "1:1" 
- Added tooltip "Actual Size (100%)" for clarity
- Result: Clean, professional button appearance

**Code Change:**
```python
# OLD
self.zoom_actual_btn = QPushButton("1️⃣ Actual")

# NEW  
self.zoom_actual_btn = QPushButton("1:1")
self.zoom_actual_btn.setToolTip("Actual Size (100%)")
```

### 🖼️ **2. Default View Mode Set to "Fit"**
**Problem**: Images opened at actual size, often too large for the viewport
**Solution**: 
- Automatically call `zoom_fit()` when loading any image
- Provides optimal viewing experience by default
- Users can still zoom to actual size using the 1:1 button

**Code Change:**
```python
def load_image(self, image_path: str):
    # ...existing code...
    self.image_label.set_image(pixmap)
    
    # Set default view to fit
    self.image_label.zoom_fit()  # NEW: Auto-fit on load
```

### 📊 **3. Enhanced Metadata Display**
**Problem**: Plain text metadata was hard to read and not visually appealing
**Solution**: 
- Implemented professional HTML table layout
- Added proper spacing and borders
- Enhanced typography with better fonts
- Organized information into clear sections
- Improved EXIF data formatting
- Better error message presentation

**Improvements:**
- **Visual Structure**: Clean table layout with headers and borders
- **Typography**: Changed from Consolas to Segoe UI for better readability
- **Spacing**: Proper padding and margins for easy scanning
- **Organization**: Clear sections for File Info, Image Properties, and EXIF Data
- **Data Formatting**: Better handling of fractions and complex values
- **Width**: Increased from 300px to 320px for better table display

**Before:**
```
📁 File Information
📄 Name: image.jpg
📂 Directory: C:\Photos
...
```

**After:**
```html
<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
  <td colspan="2" style="padding: 8px; font-weight: bold;">📁 File Information</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 5px; font-weight: bold;">📄 Name:</td>
